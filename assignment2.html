<div class="column"> <h2>Martin luther king's insipirational quotes </h2>
<p>
 “We must accept finite disappointment, but never lose infinite hope.”
<br><br>
 “Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.”
<br><br>
“Forgiveness is not an occasional act. It is a permanent attitude.”
<br><br>
“I have decided to stick with love. Hate is too great a burden to bear.”<br><br>
 “Faith is taking the first step even when you don’t see the whole staircase.”

<br><br>
“Life’s most persistent and urgent question is, ‘What are you doing for others?’”<br><br>
“Never succumb to the temptation of bitterness.”<br><br>
“Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.”<br>
 “We may have all come on different ships, but we’re in the same boat now.”

<div class="column"><h2>Mandela's inspirational quotes</h2><p>
<p>
“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.”
<br><br>
“It is in your hands, to make a better world for all who live in it.”
<br><br>
“A winner is a dreamer who never gives up.”
<br>
<br>
“Money won't create success, the freedom to make it will.”<br><br>
“It is in the character of growth that we should learn from both pleasant and unpleasant experiences.”<br><br>
“It is not our diversity which divides us; it is not our ethnicity, or religion or culture that divides us. Since we have achieved our freedom, there can only be one division amongst us: between those who cherish democracy and those who do not.”
<br>
<br>
“For to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others.”<br><br>
“A critical, independent and investigative press is the lifeblood of any democracy. The press must be free from state interference. It must have the economic strength to stand up to the blandishments of government officials. It must have sufficient independence from vested interests to be bold and inquiring without fear or favour. It must enjoy the protection of the constitution, so that it can protect our rights as citizens.”<br><br><br><br>
